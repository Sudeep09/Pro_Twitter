# Pro_Twitter
1. Fetch comments or replies to any social media platform of your choice - Twitter, Facebook, reddit, etc. The only criteria is that there needs to be a message and a "rating", might be the likes or dislike on the message, but it should be reduceable to a single integer. How you reduce it depends on the platform you choose and the reasoning behind the reduction.

2. Extract the most important "keywords" or "key phrases" in the reviews you fetch. They don't have to be per comment, but have to be the most important keywords or phrases per selected social post. In essence, reading the list of keywords or phrases you extract should give a reader a rough insight into what people are discussing in the comments without reading all the comments.

3. Given a bit of text, rank it according to the likelihood of it becoming popular for the given post, i.e. gets a high rating in (1) above. The levels of ranks you choose are up to you, at least three is expected.
